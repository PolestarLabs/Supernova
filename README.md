# **THIS CODEBASE IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED SINCE MID 2018**
Pollux is being rewritten on Eris.js and this entire codebase is *extremely* deprecated (like, *really*). 

The new codebase will be closed-source. The latest Vanilla snapshot before upgrading *might* be pushed to this repo, no promises.

*This repo will be kept here just as a dark reminder of how bad its code used to be*
